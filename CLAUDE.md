# Discord Messages Reader — Claude Code Notes

## Project Layout

```
appModules/
  discord/__init__.py       — Main AppModule (stable Discord)
  discordptb/__init__.py    — Re-exports AppModule for Discord PTB
  discordcanary/__init__.py — Re-exports AppModule for Discord Canary
tests/
  conftest.py               — NVDA stub installation + app_module fixture
  test_filter.py            — _filterAndAnnounce unit tests
  test_announce.py          — _scheduleAnnounce / _doAnnounce unit tests
  test_uia.py               — _getLatestMessageViaUIA mock tests
  test_smoke.py             — Lifecycle and event handler smoke tests
manifest.ini                — NVDA add-on manifest
build.py                    — Creates dist/*.nvda-addon (ZIP)
pytest.ini                  — Runs tests from tests/ directory
```

## Build and Test

```bash
python build.py             # produces dist/discord_messages_reader-X.X.X.nvda-addon
pytest                      # 68 tests, all should pass
```

Pytest is installed at:
`C:\Users\blind\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python313\Scripts\pytest.exe`

## Installed Location (for rapid iteration)

```
C:\Users\blind\AppData\Roaming\nvda\addons\discord_messages_reader\appModules\discord\__init__.py
```

After editing, deploy with:
```bash
cp appModules/discord/__init__.py \
   "$APPDATA/nvda/addons/discord_messages_reader/appModules/discord/__init__.py"
```
Then restart NVDA (Ctrl+Alt+N) to reload.

## Key Design Decisions

- **UIA polling (500ms)** is the primary message detection mechanism.
  IAccessible WinEvent hooks are unreliable in Discord's Chromium renderer
  when focus is in the edit field.
- **WinEvent hook** is kept only as a fast-path trigger and for `_lastHookTime`
  (used to suppress spurious `event_valueChange` when Discord clears the edit
  field after sending a message). It is debounced to avoid stacking UIA reads
  during navigation.
- **`disableBrowseModeByDefault = True`** suppresses NVDA's virtual buffer for
  Discord, which is the recommended approach for Electron apps.
- **Message dedup** is content-based only (`_lastText`). No time window — the
  UIA text includes a timestamp so genuinely new messages always differ.
- **Foreground guard** in `_uiaRead` prevents announcements when Discord is
  not the active window.

## Log Level

The add-on uses `log.debug` for per-message lines (UIA read, announcing,
speaking) so they do not appear in users' INFO-level logs. Load/terminate
events and errors use `log.info` / `log.warning`.

## Discord PTB / Canary

`discordptb/__init__.py` and `discordcanary/__init__.py` each contain a
single line: `from discord import AppModule`. NVDA matches add-on AppModules
by executable name (without extension, lowercase).

## Supported Discord Formats

IAccessible name format: `"username , body , HH:MM AM"`
UIA plain-text format: the name IS the message body (less common path)

Both are handled by `_filterAndAnnounce` and `_doAnnounce`.
